When a request is accepted, the requesting employee receives an email announcing the approval of his request, in the same way that the responsible supervisor receives another notification that supports his response. 

##### **ii. Denying a Request**
When an request is denied, the supervisor does not authorize the employee's departure as scheduled. 
After this action, the requesting employee receives an email announcing the refusal of his request, in the same way that the responsible supervisor receives another notification that supports his response. 

Once the request has received the necessary number of answers in relation to the number of supervisors and the amount of time requested, the status of the request changes from Wait to Accepted or Denied as appropriate. This change is notified by email to:
