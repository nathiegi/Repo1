# 3.0	Moderator´s Manual
Like the user, the moderator can perform the actions in WishGrid mentioned in point 2.

After the user creates a suggestion, the moderator will receive a notification by email with the explanation and the link of the new suggestion.

*Illustration 1.20 – Email, New Suggestion was created*

When you create a suggestion, the application takes you to the detail, where you can approve it or reject it (the suggestion will not appear in the list until it is approved or rejected).

The new suggestion is initialized with the state "New". 
The moderator selects the state of the suggestion, there are two possible states: "Suggested" and "Rejected".
![Illustration 1 21 Status Suggestion](/uploads/wish-grid/illustration-1-21-status-suggestion.jpg "Illustration 1 21 Status Suggestion")
